# YoloV3 Car counter
This is a demo project that uses YoloV3 neural network to count vehicles on a given video. The detection happens every x frames where x can be specified. Other times the dlib library is used for tracking previously detected vehicles. Furthermore, you can edit confidence detection level, number of frames to count vehicle as detected before removing it from trackable list, the maximum distance from centroid (CentroidTracker class).

YoloV3 model is pretrained and downloaded (Internet connection is required for the download process).
## Dependencies
